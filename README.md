# How to Run the Project


## `Check the test online on Firebase`


I have hosted the test on firebase 
https://testprojectfahad.web.app/

&nbsp;

## `Running the project Locally`

To run the project locally you will need nodeJS version 14 and npm version 6.

&nbsp;

You will be able to run the project by executing following command.

``` npm start ```

## `Problem with running ITunes API`

As I am using itune API which is at secure https channel and protected by CORs you will not able to run the API services locally.

&nbsp;

To unblock CORs for local development install a chrome plugin https://add0n.com/access-control.html that will unblock the CORs
